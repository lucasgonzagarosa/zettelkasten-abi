# Zettelkasten Vault


Zettelkasten is a note-taking and organization method that involves creating individual notes on small cards or slips of paper, and then linking them together through a system of tags or keywords. It can be useful in software engineering as it allows for the efficient organization and retrieval of information, facilitating idea generation, knowledge management, and project planning.
